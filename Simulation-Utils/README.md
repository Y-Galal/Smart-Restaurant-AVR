# Bluetooth Library
This is a bluetooth library to simulate in proteus.
## To include this library:
Extract the compressed file and copy the 2 files to this location 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\LIBRARY"

# Bluetooth Example
This is a simple example to make sure that the library is installed correctly.
Two bluetooth modules are connected to a virtual terminal and to connect the two modules together you should make a virtual port pair using a software called (Virtual Serial Port Driver) then right click on the modules and enter your pair (COMx) then start the simulation. When you write on a virtual terminal you should see what you was writing in the other terminal.

Note: if the virtual terminal windows didn't popup, close the simulation and change the simulation file name then open it again.
